					<h4>The Walk</h4>
					<p>
						<span class="fancy">She</span> never claimed to walk elegantly but eloquently she spoke<br>
						Ideas in her mind but never a loud in the crowd she is silent<br>
						She walks and the streets talk, talking shit feigning grit they just talk<br>
						They never step to her, they never challenge her, they just walk<br>
						<br>
						The eyes on her, so intense, so intent, ears attentive to her beats<br>
						But the size of her, into a child’s pocket she would fit so neat<br>
						And her dreads? Ha, ha, ha, dead on but they take up half of her<br>
						And her dread? That she’ll never find the missing heart of her<br>
						<br>
						A sibling, MIA<br>
						But she’s prays they are not DOA<br>
						They are the soul that she missed to her dismay.<br>
						So she continues the search day by day.<br>
						<br>
						Lyric! Her name given at her birth,<br>
						 And it doth serve<br>
						Her spirit well,<br>
						Deep as a well she was, Keep others well because<br>
						She is kind, with a mind first rate, never hesitate<br>
						To serve, is she blind?<br>
						To herself.<br>
						<br>
