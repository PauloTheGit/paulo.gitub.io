					<h4>Privvy</h4>
						<p>
							<span class="fancy">&quot;And</span> so, what wise words do you have for me?&quot;<br>
							She asked of he and he said to she almost silenty<br>
							&quot;Listen with your ears, see with your eyes and feel with you hand<br>
							Truth!&quot;<br>
							&quot;What wise words do you have for me????!!!&quot; she asked repeatedly and heatedly and bear with me, because you will see<br> the words he spoke to little she...<br>
							&quot;You do not wish to seek truth, but to be told truth, so come to my booth and we'll rap some "truth".<br>
							Your kin is here, here in town, look around he can be found and I'll show you now. On the seventh door on the seventh street, you<br> shall once more, your brother meet&quot;<br>
							&quot;Him? I can now meet, you have the deets and now here's a sheet and here's a pen, it's no mean feat, so write it then!&quot;<br>
							<br>
							Privvy, with his time he's chaste, he took the moment, made not with haste.<br> 
							He wrote<br>
							Without approximation, the destination to her elation and he spoke<br>
							&quot;Here on the sheet are indeed the deets that you seek, you feeling me?&quot;<br>
							<br>
							She took the sheet silently, not one more word she spoke to he.<br>
