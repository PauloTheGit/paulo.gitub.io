					<h4>The Mission</h4>
						
						<p><span class="fancy">Though</span> school is out, she is devout to her books<br>
						In her studies she is way ahead of the game, smarter than she looks<br>
						As she stood at the station, she felt thought formations and the thoughts became herself<br>
						Her obsession with social progression soon became second to herself<br>
						Her own soul and goal, to find that signifcant brother who was her brother<br>
						Never bothered by that thought before<br>
						Because social justice was the only purpose, it was her law<br>
						<br>
						"How, should I start?" she thought to herself, but "Now I should start" was the thought that she felt.<br>
						Who's got the tools of the trade, who's got the skinny?<br>
						An aquantance she made, known only as Privvy.<br>
