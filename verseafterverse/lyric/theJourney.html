					<h4>The Journey</h4>
					<p>
						<span class="fancy">As</span> she walks, her hands rise above her eyes to shield the sun<br>
						She is now one, with her journey.<br>
						She lacks in patience, so her arrival could not disguise itself as early.<br>
						<br>
						With the school year over, the summer showed her this.<br>
						The precipice, not of a kiss or studies missed but of this<br>
						The promise of a purpose shift beyond the study list or an empty kiss<br>
						The journey this!<br>
						<br>
						And so, she reached into her coat, to see the note that Privvy wrote.<br>
						To peruse the deets of the truth doth she seek now on route upon approach<br>
						<br>
						Appeared a man, who slammed his hand upon her face.<br>
						And then she tastes, blood, but in her blood is violence.<br> 
						And violence begets violence, so right then<br>
						She stands tall but all in all she stands small compared almost to all.<br> 
						Her fired eyes comprised of a spirit without compromise and this guys  mind could not conceptualise the world of hurt, her tiny hands<br> would now devise.<br>
