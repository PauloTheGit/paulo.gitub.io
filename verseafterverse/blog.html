					<p>There's a lot to unpack there. 
Of course I would look at this from a secular perspective.  So it's difficult for me to look at it from a biblical perspective when I don't use the bible as my complete literal guide to life. 

As far as I'm aware trans people have always existed and I believe there is some evidence that there may be a genetic component to it. However I don't believe it's as common as trans rights activists would have you believe. There are more and more categories that are being placed under the trans umbrella. 

I don't want to overcomplicate the issue but there are people who suffer from gender dysphoria and those who don't. All I'm  saying is that we shouldn't be in a rush to label anyone who suffers from GD as trans not because of transphobia but because we shouldn't always look to medicalise our problems. This said, it is possible that for some people transitioning is the best thing for them. I just don't think it's that common.
